# Data Structures and Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains various data structures and algorithm implementations in C++. Below are the main sections and their corresponding subsections:


## 1. Linked List

- Implementation of a linked list data structure.
  

## 2. Binary Tree

- ### Huffman Code:

The implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm allows for lossless data compression by creating variable-length binary codes for each character in a given input string. The most frequently occurring characters are assigned shorter codes, optimizing the overall compression.

- ### Algebraic Expression:

Parsing and evaluation of algebraic expressions using binary trees are demonstrated here. The expression is parsed and represented as a binary tree, enabling efficient evaluation and manipulation.

- ### Binary Tree Forms:

This subsection covers the conversion of binary trees between pre-order, in-order, and post-order forms. Functions are provided to convert from one form to another, allowing for visualization and analysis of different tree representations.

- ### Min Heap and Max Heap:

The implementation of min and max heaps using binary trees is presented. These binary heaps are fundamental data structures used to efficiently retrieve the minimum or maximum element from a set of elements.

- ### Backtracking:

Various backtracking algorithms and problem-solving techniques are explored in this subsection. Backtracking is a general algorithmic paradigm for finding all (or some) solutions to a problem by incrementally building candidates and eliminating those that fail to satisfy the conditions.


## 3. Graph

- ### Graph Representation:

This subsection focuses on the implementation of graphs using an adjacency matrix and demonstrates how to convert a matrix representation to an adjacency list. Graphs are powerful data structures that model relationships between objects.

- ### Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm used to explore all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It efficiently visits all the vertices and edges of the graph, making it useful for applications such as finding the shortest path.

- ### Depth-First Search (DFS):

Depth-First Search is another graph traversal algorithm used to explore all the vertices and edges of a graph. It searches deeper into a branch before backtracking, often employed in applications like cycle detection and connected component analysis.

- ### Topological Sort:

Topological sorting is an algorithm to linearly order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This subsection presents an implementation of topological sort using Depth-First Search, crucial for scheduling tasks with dependencies.
